# text adventure

A text-based adventure about a student who needs to create a text-based adventure as an assignment, and is thoroughly bored.

Hello! This project was created as an assignment for school. If you would like to try it out, follow the below steps:

1. Create a new macOS terminal profile.
2. Give it a black background.
3. Reduce the font size to 9.
4. Reduce the spacing to 0.56 and 0.5.
5. Run main.py, and press a key to continue.

In it's current state, this project is very much unfinished. I plan to return to it some day to finish it off, and potentially create a new terminal game engine from scratch, similar to Unity, Source, or Unreal. However, if you want to, you may fork this project to work on it yourself.
